<p><strong>Q1. A denote the event &#39;student is female&#39; and let B denote the event &#39;student is French&#39;. In a class of 100 students suppose 60 are French and suppose that 10 of the French students are females. Find the probability that if I pick a French student, it will be a girl, that is, find P(A|B).</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A) 1/3</li>
	<li>B) 2/3</li>
	<li>C) 1/6</li>
	<li>D) 2/6</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 10 out of 100 students are both French and female, then<br />
P(AandB)=10100<br />
Also. 60 out of the 100 students are French, so<br />
P(B)=60100<br />
So the required probability is:<br />
P(A|B)=P(AandB)P(B)=10/10060/100=16</p>

<p>Answer is <strong>C</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q2. What is the probability that the total of two dice will be greater than 8, given that the first die is a 6?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A) 1/3</li>
	<li>B) 2/3</li>
	<li>C) 1/6</li>
	<li>D) 2/6</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer is <strong>B</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q3. If E1 and E2 are two events, how do you represent the conditional probability given that E2 occurs given that E1 has occurred?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A) P(E1)/P(E2)</li>
	<li>B) P(E1+E2)/P(E1)</li>
	<li>C) P(E2)/P(E1)</li>
	<li>D) P(E2)/(P(E1+E2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer is <strong>C</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q4. Question-26. There are 5000 different color balls, out of which 1200 are a pink color. What is the maximum likelihood estimate for the proportion of &quot;pink&quot; items in the test set of color balls?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A) 2.4</li>
	<li>B) 24 0</li>
	<li>C) .24</li>
	<li>D) 48</li>
	<li>E) 4.8</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer is <strong>C</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q5. Projecting a multi-dimensional dataset onto which vector has the greatest variance?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A)&nbsp;first principal component</li>
	<li>B)&nbsp;first eigenvector</li>
	<li>C)&nbsp;not enough information is given to answer</li>
	<li>D)&nbsp;second eigenvector</li>
	<li>E)&nbsp;second principal component</li>
</ul>

<p>The method based on principal component analysis (PCA) evaluates the features according to the projection of the largest eigenvector of the correlation matrix on the initial dimensions, the method based on Fisher&#39;s linear discriminant analysis evaluates. Them according to the magnitude of the components of the discriminant vector.<br />
The first principal component corresponds to the greatest variance in the data, by definition. If we project the data onto the first principal component line, the data is more spread out (higher variance) than if projected onto any other line, including other principal components.</p>

<p>Answer is <strong>A</strong></p>
